Prosper Loan data was investigated, and the key findings are that the Prosper Rating and Score are fairly accurate for lenders to predict loan outcome an and therefore risk and profit margins.This rating system does not align with the rating of the Consumer Credit Agency, which needed to be evaluated differently. A major underlying causality for these outcomes however are the higher Interest rates for lower rated Borrowers. Further, the final observation that showed that loans are finished in most cases prior to the end of the term of the loan agreement allow a more efficient capital allocation for lenders.
